#####**Editor :**
    
    In general an editor refers to any program capable of editing files. 
    Image editors such as Adobe Photoshop.
    The term editor is commonly used to refer to a text editor, which is a software program that allows users to create or manipulate plain text computer files.


#####**Eclipse [Editor for Android] :**
     
     In computer programming, Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE).
     It contains a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the environment. 
     Eclipse is written mostly in Java and its primary use is for developing Java applications, but it may also be used to develop applications in other programming languages through the use 
of plugins, including: Ada, ABAP, C, C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Lua, NATURAL, Perl, PHP, Prolog, Python, R, Ruby.
     Android Development Tools (ADT) is a plugin for the Eclipse IDE that is designed to give you a powerful, integrated environment in which to build Android applications.
     Eclipse is a Java-based open source platform that allows a software developer to create a customized development environment (IDE) from plug-in components built by Eclipse members. 
     Eclipse is managed and directed by the  Eclipse.org Consortium.
     The original goal of Eclipse was to create and foster an open source IDE community that would complement the community that surrounds Apache. 
     Eclipse supports plug-ins that allow developers to develop and test code written in other languages.

#####**Eclipse Juno :**

     Juno is Version 4.2 of the platform and is the first to be built on Eclipse 4. As such it brings several new features including a revamped interface.
     Eclipse Juno includes an easier way to work with more than one mobile SDK.
     Eclipse 4.2 becomes the mainstream platform for the Eclipse community.
     with the Eclipse 3.x family of releases put into maintenance mode. 
     To make migration less painful, Eclipse 4.2 includes a compatibility layer that allows existing plugins and RCP applications to run under the new version.
     An addition to the new version is a new plugin called Code Recommenders. This is designed to improve code completion in Eclipse by analysing how Java applications use the language's APIs.
    

#####**Advantages of using eclipse : **

     A major advantage to an open source development platform is that it allows an IT department to mix and match development tools rather than being committed to a single vendor's suite of 
development products.

     The biggest advantages in eclipse are the following : 

     Code Completion : Instead of digging through documentation we should be able to tab your way through methods and save yourself a lot of writing

         Refactoring : Global Find and Replace is no replacement for good refactoring support, that starts with renaming functions, variables, classes, ... and ends with some of the functionality that we can find in current Java IDE.

     Syntax Checking : It helps to write the correct code while we write.

     Many flexible tools and frameworks for building various types of applications.

     It has a free and an open source.

     It is really extendable and configurable.
